# My Notebook Stack

This project represents the infrastructure I use when dabbling with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

No actual notebooks are contained within, only the files needed to setup and run the containers I need.

These files are not held under any license, offered as-is, and are *NOT* promised to even work.
